# GRClone_Ajax
Self replicating application project by Michael Stattelman

ZERO Installs, Single file execution, TRUE Single Page application. Can be deployed to Serverless Architecture or a public web host provider. 

# Prerequisites: 
1) Have a github account (https://github.com) 

**(HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and GitHub api calls.)**

# How it works: 
Upon entry of your username and password the the following occurs: 
1)  Your are authenticated with Github. 
2) A repository gets created. 
3) The base index.html file gets posted. This application replicates itself code and all to the users own github repository for editing enhancements or updates.

# How to deploy:
1) Once executed and the repository has been created in your github account.
2) Got to your account on github and then click on the GRClone repository.
3) Browse the tabs at the top of the directory listing( Code | Issues | Pull requests | Projects | Wiki | Insights | Settings) and click on Settings.
4) Scroll Down to the GitHub Pages section.
5) In the source section you should see a dropdown list next to a save button (Currently it should read None).
6) Change that to master branch and click Save.
7) You will see a highlighted message that states Your site is ready to be published at and then a custom URL.
    Something like (https://yourusername.github.io/GRClone/)
8) Click on that URL(initially you might see a site not found message). After about 10 minutes as the settings need to propogate through Githubs servers, refresh the page and it will mirror the one that created it.
9) All Done.
